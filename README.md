_In the Moment_ is a feedback app designed to reduce bias in performance evaluations by offering real time manager feedback and employee performance analysis on a regular basis.

This manager view allows you to choose an employee to evaluate and assess their performance in three key areas of their role description. After submitting your review you will see a chart of the employees self-rating and previous manager evaluations.

Charts are created using Chart.js https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/

## Roadmap

Future iterations will compare manager and employee ratings and suggest a manager 1:1 to realign on expectations if the difference is greater than 4, or if an employee is consistently rated under a 3 for an area of their responsibilities.
